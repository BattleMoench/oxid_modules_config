Tools to export, backup and import OXID eShop modules, module settings, shop settings and module activation.
There are 2 ways to use the functionality:

* via a GUI based dashboard in eShop administration area under _Service -> Module Configuration Im-/Exporter_. 

All relevant modules configuration is being used including: Versions, Extended classes, Module classes, Templates, Blocks, Settings and Events. 

## Installation
 - Copy the content of `copy_this/` folder to OXID eShop root folder
 - Activate the module in administration area
 
## Development
In order to run the tests you need to have the [OXID testing-library v1.0.6](https://github.com/OXID-eSales/testing_library/tree/v1.0.6) installed. As best practice the testing-library
should be installed in shop vendor directory.
